# sdfer-rs (M/SDF Text Renderer)

**sdfer-rs** is a *fast* and *low-cost* text renderer using **M/SDFs** (Multichannel Signed Distance Fields).Å¾

> WIP

It was inspired by this [Valve paper](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf) and the need for rendering text in 3D perspective without losing quality while magnifying or minifying.
